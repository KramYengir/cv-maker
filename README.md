This was our first React Assignment, where we must demonstrate our understanding of the basics of React and more specifically, React Components

### What I've learned...
- Setting up the react environment via Vite
- How to share state between components
- What causes a component to reset or reload
- Using JSX
- A better understanding of JS array functions: Map, Filter & Reduce
- How React makes building UIs more efficient & intuitive (wish we had it sooner...)
- How to use the ReactIcons & html2pdf libraries


### Where I need improvement...
- How to pass state between components more efficiently
- I feel my separating & organizing of comonents could be more efficient & less repetitive
- Especially making better use of array functions to make my code less repetitive within the components
- Having a cleaner and more distinct styling system
